/**
 * Introduction
 * Little Petya very much likes sequences. Recently he has received one as a gift from his mother.
 * Petya didn't like it at once. He decided to make a replacement. After the replacement Petya sorted the sequence by the numbers' non-decreasing.
 * Now he is asking himself: What is the minimal possible value I could have got after the replacement and sorting the sequence?
 * 
 *  About the replacement
 * Choose exactly one element from the sequence and replace it with another integer > 0. It is not allowed to replace a number with itself or to change no number at all.
 * 
 * Task
 *   Find the minimal possible sequence after performing a valid replacement and sorting the sequence.
 * 
 * Input:
 *   Input contains sequence with N integers. All elements of the sequence > 0. The sequenc will never be empty.
 * 
 * Output:
 *   Return sequence with N integers â€” the minimum possible values of each sequence element after one replacement and the sorting are performed.
 * 
 * Examples:
 *   ([1,2,3,4,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
 *   ([4,2,1,3,5])  =>  [1,1,2,3,4]
 *   ([2,3,4,5,6])  =>  [1,2,3,4,5]
 *   ([2,2,2])      =>  [1,2,2]
 *   ([42])         =>  [1]

/**
 * 
 * Idea here is to search for maximum value element in an array replace it with 1, 
 * If maximum is 1, replace with 2
